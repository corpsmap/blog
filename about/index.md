CorpsMap is a team at the Remote Sensing / GIS Center of Expertise, part of the ERDC Cold Regions Research Engineering Laboratory. We build geospatial applications for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Army, and other Department of Defense organizations.

We have a commitment to pushing the bounds when it comes to geospatial technology and focus on web development, geo-visualization and active and passive remote sensing from the full range of sensor platforms and spectral tools.

This site is mainly designed to be a knowledge sharing platform for our team, but likely has content useful to a wider audience.

All views expressed here are those of our team members and do not reflect any policy of or endorcement by USACE, Army or the US Government.
