Below is the internet archive version of a post I wrote about 5 years ago, let's see how it holds up:

I'm often asked what resources I recommend for folks wanting to get into web development or just keep up with that fast-paced ecosystem.  So here we go.  This is far from an exhaustive list,  the links below are just some of the training, interesting articles and posts and other resources that I've come across on the web.  If you find something that would fit well here, let me know and I'll add it.  I'll try to keep this up to date as time goes on.

Current as of April 2019

On-line Training

Wes Bos is a Canadian developer who spends most of his time putting together online tutorials and courses.  He usually tries to stay up on the most current way of doing things and I generally recommend his courses once you feel like you're comfortable with the basics.  He has others, but the main courses that I'd suggest are below:

ES6.io

CSSGrid.io

ReactForBeginners.com (this may be a little old since React has grown a lot since it came out but the main patterns and concepts stay the same)
LearnRedux.com (good introduction into the Redux state management approach / lib)
LearnNode.com (if you're interested in using JavaScript on the server as well as in the browser this is a good intro)
Introduction to React by Kent Dobbs

Reads

WebDev 101 is my attempt at laying out an introduction into how the web works.  It's designed as read-ahead material for an intro course that goes into more detail, but if you want a refresher on some of the high level concepts it's a good place to look.
Architecting UIs for Change - Henrik is the author of the redux-bundler library I typically use for state management in React.js applications.  He does a good job at laying out the main considerations for developing apps that are resilient to scope creep (never seen that before, you?).  For a more in-depth tutorial in building complex web applications take a look at the Advanced Web Development Course (link coming soon).
A longer read by Henrik from above is the Human Redux book that he wrote while coming up with the bundler approach.  It's good if you like thinking about the architecture of client apps.
JavaScript, the good parts - oldy but goody.

Follows

One of the best ways to keep up with the changing web development environment is to follow developers who are influential in the community.  Twitter isn't good for everything, but I think it's a good way to keep track of the web dev zeitgeist.  I'm not endorsing everything these folks post, but they're a good place to start.  Most of these folks post good dev content and often speak at tech conferences, I recommend looking their talks up on YouTube.  Disclaimer, not all those below are web dev focused, but all are good folks to keep an eye on.
